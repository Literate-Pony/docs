Shenanigan is a community-driven ecosystem built for athletes, by athletes to produce tokenized incentivization cards.

The world economy, where Olympians make \$15,000 on average a year and college athletes can barely afford their car lease, fiscally misrepresents the large majority of athletes. We at Shenanigan believe athletes deserve compensation for their daily work innovating their sport. There’s no doubt athlete’s harbor intrinsic value; Shenanigan wants to encapsulate that value in NFT collectibles.

We promote an athlete through a @livepeer livestream, establishing a platform to boast one’s talents and better their craft. This live platform will allow him, her, or they to grow as an individual and as a community. Shenanigan wants to bring gamification into the training process.
